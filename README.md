# A-star-on-any-image
The program finds the path between first red pixel and the first green pixel and treats black pixels as obstacles

# How it works
The program takes the first red pixel as the start node,the first green pixel as the end node and all the black pixels as obstacles.
It can only analyze absolute colors.Images should be stored in examples folder, pass the image name with its suffix(for example "example1.png")
